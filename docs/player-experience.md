# Design the game from the player's perspective
Status: working design, not a finalized feature order.

## Confirmed foundation
Players use Java Minecraft and a required resource pack. They form factions, build on the main survival world, and encounter PvP outside designated safe areas. Death drops carried items, weapons and armor. KOTH and Jabba are proven activities. Offline bases may become vulnerable after warpoints are depleted. Force powers are deferred.

## Proposed everyday loop
Establish a base with friends, gather supplies, prepare equipment, venture out, fight or complete an activity, return with loot, and fund the next expedition. Building gives the faction a home and stockpile. Gear replacement needs a deliberate cost because death is full-loot.

## Design order
1. Describe the experience: what the player sees, chooses, risks, earns and does next.
2. Set rules and failure cases: death, disconnect, restart, abuse, safe zones and other players.
3. Choose the smallest playable version and the dependencies it needs.
4. Define the parameters used by that version.
5. Implement the system, then add and balance content through configuration.
6. Play it before expanding the feature.

Use [the feature brief](templates/feature.md). Record unresolved gameplay choices as unresolved; infrastructure work must not silently decide them.

## Proposed playable milestones
| Slice | Player can… | Why it comes here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrival and protection | Join, accept the pack, understand the safe starting area | Establishes a place to test everything |
| Basic combat | Obtain one blaster and armor set, fight, die and re-equip | Tests the smallest full-loot loop |
| Faction home | Join a faction, claim a base and cooperate without friendly damage | Gives combat and gathering a shared purpose |
| Supplies and progression | Gather, craft and buy a useful replacement loadout | Makes loss and recovery sustainable |
| One event | Compete in KOTH or run Jabba for useful rewards | Adds a repeatable social objective |
| Mobility | Use a speeder, then test aerial transport | Builds on meaningful destinations |
| Raiding | Understand vulnerability and perform a limited explosive breach | Requires stable combat, claims and recovery rules |

This is a starting sequence for discussion. Resource planets, travel details, dungeon contention and warpoint balancing still need decisions.

## Configuration-driven systems
Use explicit schemas and stable IDs. YAML declares content and tuning; Java implements behavior, validation, lifecycle and integration.

- Items: ID, presentation/model reference, category, recipe and acquisition.
- Sabers: item reference, damage, stamina costs, block/deflect rules and supported behavior type.
- Vehicles: model reference, movement type, seats, speed/acceleration, fuel, health and supported weapons.
- Events: location, schedule, participant rules, objectives and rewards.
- Resources: location/node type, yields, regeneration and access rules.

Only add parameters when the implemented feature uses them. First prove one item/saber/vehicle and a second configuration variant; generalize the variation we actually need. Avoid inventing a scripting language or a universal effect system.

Validate bounds and cross-references at load time. Errors name the file and key. Editing a price or speed should not require Java changes; adding a new behavior may. Reload only where active-state handling is defined. Schema changes require migrations for saved data and clear compatibility notes.
